Problem Definition: The database presented is the aggregated data of collisions for all years from 2004 to present.
So, We want to use the Machine Learning to predict the chance and severity of the car accidents (collisions)

Reason : Since the accidents can occur every time you drive, having a program to predict the chance to have an accident will make a better decision for travelling
With the output of the severity, the travellers can decide the path to go when the chances to get an accident are nearly equal for two paths.
